# Basic Portfolio Website (HTML + CSS)
A simple personal portfolio website I built in 9th grade to showcase my skills, interests, and projects.
This is a beginner-friendly personal portfolio website built entirely with HTML and CSS. It includes sections like Home, About Me, Gallery, Skills, and Contact. I created this as a school-level project when I first started learning web development
## Demo




## Features

- Clean and simple UI
- Sticky navigation bar
- Smooth scrolling to sections
- Gallery section with images
- Skills showcase with hover animations
- Contact form layout
- Fully responsive layout using only CSS


## How It Works

- The HTML file structures the content into sections.
- The CSS file styles each part of the page, controlling layout, colors, alignment, and animations.
- The navbar links use internal anchors (#about, #skills, etc.) to scroll smoothly to different sections. 
- CSS handles hover effects, transitions, and the background image on the home page.

## Installation

### 1.) How to Run
Simply open index.html in any web browser:
``` bash
 open index.html
```
or on Windows:
``` bash
 start index.html
```
